## Issues
Main issue was starting out and getting comfortable with javascript and the assignment. Running the test was a really helpful tool in toruble shooting my mistakes. 
Also struggled with aplyying multiple methods to one object for instance the .trim and .toLowerCase, but was able to figure out after some trial and error.
